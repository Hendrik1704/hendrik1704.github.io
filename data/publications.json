        "abstract": "We investigate medium-induced modifications to jet substructure observables that characterize hard splitting patterns in central Pb-Pb collisions at the top energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using a multistage Monte Carlo simulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent medium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\\gamma$-tagged jets. The results show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to gluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop prong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the groomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification, $\\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear signals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects dominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard substructures in $\\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the jet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations for $\\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered events containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of these observables for future Bayesian analysis."

        "abstract": "QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes."

Monte Carlo simulations of hard scattering and energy loss in heavy-ion collisions are performed using parameters tuned in a previous study of the nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) for inclusive jets and high-$p_T$ hadrons. We obtain a good reproduction of the experimental data for photon triggered jet $R_{AA}$, as measured by the ATLAS detector, the distribution of the ratio of jet to photon $p_T$ ($X_{\\rm J \\gamma}$), measured by both CMS and ATLAS, and the photon-jet azimuthal correlation as measured by CMS. We obtain a moderate description of the photon triggered jet $I_{AA}$, as measured by STAR. A noticeable improvement in the comparison is observed when one goes beyond prompt photons and includes bremsstrahlung and decay photons, revealing their significance in certain kinematic regions, particularly at $X_{J\\gamma} > 1$. Moreover, azimuthal angle correlations demonstrate a notable impact of non-prompt photons on the distribution, emphasizing their role in accurately describing experimental results. This work highlights the success of the multistage model of jet modification to straightforwardly predict (this set of) photon triggered jet observables. This comparison, along with the role played by non-prompt photons, has important consequences on the inclusion of such observables in a future Bayesian analysis."

        "abstract": "The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport parameter $\\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference, incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference determination of $\\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration of $\\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation."

        "abstract": "A new framework, called x-scape, for the combined study of both hard and soft transverse momentum sectors in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) and proton-nucleus ($p$-$A$) collisions is set up. A dynamical initial state is set up using the 3d-Glauber model with transverse locations of hotspots within each incoming nucleon. A hard scattering that emanates from two colliding hotspots is carried out using the Pythia generator. Initial state radiation from the incoming hard partons is carried out in a new module called I-matter, which includes the longitudinal location of initial splits. The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium. Outgoing showers are simulated using the matter generator, and results are presented for both cases, allowing for and not allowing for energy loss. First comparisons between this hard-soft model and single inclusive hadron and jet data from $p$-$p$ and minimum bias $p$-$Pb$ collisions are presented. Single hadron spectra in $p$-$p$ are used to carry out a limited (in number of parameters) Bayesian calibration of the model. Fair comparisons with data are indicative of the utility of this new framework. Theoretical studies of the correlation between jet $p_T$ and event activity at mid and forward rapidity are carried out."

A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.",

These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data. Both models predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $p+p$, $p+pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions."

Therefore, photontriggered jets can be used to study the jet quenching in the QGP medium. In this work, photon-triggered jets are studied through different jet and jet substructure observables for different collision systems and energies using the JETSCAPE framework. Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies. This study highlights the importance of multistage evolution for the simultaneous description of experimental observables through different collision systems and energies using a single parameter tune.",

        "abstract": "The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports the first multi-messenger study of the QGP jet transport parameter q^ using Bayesian inference, incorporating all available hadron and jet inclusive yield and jet substructure data from RHIC and the LHC. The theoretical model utilizes virtuality-dependent in-medium partonic energy loss coupled to a detailed dynamical model of QGP evolution. Tension is observed when constraining q^ for different kinematic cuts of the inclusive hadron data. The addition of substructure data is shown to improve the constraint on q^, without inducing tension with the constraint due to inclusive observables. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of jet interactions in matter, and point to next steps in the field for comprehensive understanding of jet quenching as a probe of the QGP.",

We compare the flow harmonics $v_n$ from three types of transport simulations, with either $2\\rightarrow 2$ or $2\\rightarrow 0$ collision kernels and in the former case allowing the particles to rescatter several times or not, and from analytical calculations neglecting the gain term of the Boltzmann equation. We find that the even flow harmonics are similar in all approaches, while the odd ones differ significantly. This suggests that while even $v_n$ harmonics may to a large extent be due to the anisotropic escape probability of particles, this is not the predominant mechanism underlying the odd $v_n$ coefficients.",

In numerical simulations ranging from the quasi-collisionless case to the hydrodynamic regime, we find that the onset of $v_n$ and of related measures of anisotropic flow can be described with a simple power-law ansatz, with an exponent that depends on the amount of rescatterings in the system. In the few-rescatterings regime we perform semi-analytical calculations, based on a systematic expansion in powers of time and the cross section, which can reproduce the numerical findings.",
