        "abstract": "We investigate the use of normalizing flow (NF) models as flexible priors in Bayesian inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Trained on posteriors from previous analyses, these models can be used as informative priors, capturing non-trivial distributions and correlations, in subsequent inference tasks. We compare different training strategies and loss functions, finding that training based on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and unsupervised learning consistently yield the most accurate reproductions of reference distributions. Applied in sequential Bayesian workflows, MCMC with the NF-based priors reproduces the results of one-shot joint inferences well, provided the target distributions are unimodal. In cases with pronounced multi-modality or dataset tension, distortions may arise, underscoring the need for caution in multi-stage Bayesian inference. A comparison between the pocoMC MCMC sampler and the standard emcee sampler further demonstrates the importance of advanced and robust algorithms for exploring the posterior space. Overall, our results establish NF-based priors as a practical and efficient tool for sequential Bayesian inference in high-dimensional parameter spaces."

To this end, we perform fits that allow the effective nucleon structure parameters in Pb nuclei to differ from those of free protons. This approach directly addresses the question of whether the proton's spatial gluon distribution at intermediate to large $x$ is modified in the nuclear environment. We compare results obtained with shared and independent nucleon structure parameters and assess the impact on the simultaneous description of $\u03b3+p$ data from HERA and the LHC, as well as $\u03b3+\\mathrm{Pb}$ data from the LHC. Our findings show that there is no hint of difference in the nucleon structure beyond those already present in the CGC when embedding nucleons inside a nuclear environment."

We study how each fluctuation mode affects observables both in the initial state and in the final state of the collisions, at the end of a state-of-the-art boost-invariant hybrid evolution with KoMPoST + MUSIC + iSS + SMASH, and show that implementing a hadronic transport cascade in such a mode-by-mode analysis with reasonable statistical noise is costly but feasible."

        "abstract": "Prompt photons are important yet challenging to observe in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as they are produced in the early stages and traverse almost the entire QGP medium without interaction. Experimental analyses typically employ isolation cuts, in the hope to identify prompt photons. Most theoretical studies consider only events with actual prompt photons, assuming no contribution from isolated non-prompt photons to reduce computational cost. For the first time, we present a study that compares simulation results generated using inclusive (bremsstrahlung) and prompt-photon events with multiple experimental observables for both $p-p$ and $Pb-Pb$ collisions at $5.02$ TeV. Simulations are carried out using the multi-stage JETSCAPE framework tuned to describe the quenching of jets and hadrons. Isolated non-prompt photons are generated in hard photon bremsstrahlung, where the photon is radiated at a sufficient angle to the jet. Several photon triggered jet and jet substructure observables show significant contributions from inclusive photons, yielding an improvement in comparison with experimental data. Novel photon triggered jet substructure observables are also expected to show new structures, yet to be detected in experiment. This effort examines the significance of isolated non-prompt photons using parameters tuned for a simultaneous description of the leading hadron and jet spectrum, and thus provides an independent verification of the multistage evolution framework."

Previous studies in a simplified setup suggest that hadronic interactions could have significant effects, but a systematic analysis is needed. Using the X-SCAPE event generator with the SMASH afterburner, we study the role of hadronic rescattering on jet fragmentation hadrons. Applying this framework to $e^++e^-$ collisions, we demonstrate that even in small systems with limited particle production, hadronic interactions lead to measurable modifications in final-state hadronic and jet observables by comparing scenarios with and without afterburner rescattering."

        "abstract": "We investigate medium-induced modifications to jet substructure observables that characterize hard splitting patterns in central Pb-Pb collisions at the top energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using a multistage Monte Carlo simulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent medium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\\gamma$-tagged jets. The results show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to gluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop prong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the groomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification, $\\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear signals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects dominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard substructures in $\\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the jet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations for $\\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered events containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of these observables for future Bayesian analysis."

        "abstract": "QCD jets are considered important probes for quark gluon plasma created in collisions of nuclei at high energies. Their parton showers are significantly altered if they develop inside of a deconfined medium. Hadronization of jets is also thought to be affected by the presence of quarks and gluons. We present a systematic study of the effects of a thermal bath of partons on the hadronization of parton showers. We use the JETSCAPE framework to create parton showers both in vacuum and in a brick of quark gluon plasma. The brick setup allows important parameters, like the size of the plasma as well as the collective flow of partons, to be varied systematically. We hadronize the parton showers using Hybrid Hadronization, which permits shower partons to form strings with thermal partons, or to recombine directly with thermal partons as well as with each other. We find a sizeable amount of interaction of shower partons with thermal partons during hadronization, indicating a natural continuation of the interaction of jet and medium during this stage. The observed effects grow with the size of the medium. Collective flow easily transfers from the thermal partons onto the emerging jet hadrons. We also see a significant change in hadron chemistry as expected in the presence of quark recombination processes."

In order to explore the systematic dependence of the extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical formulation.",

The energy-momentum of both the initial hard partons and their associated beam remnants is removed from the hot spots, depleting the energy-momentum available for the formation of the bulk medium.

A known issue is the mismatch between the equation of state in the fluid-dynamical evolution and the effective one in the previous stage, which leads to discontinuities at the interface between the two models. Here we introduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy, and we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation. We study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the models and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the latter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of matching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the initial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over thermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.",

These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{\\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data. Both models predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $p+p$, $p+pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions."

Therefore, photontriggered jets can be used to study the jet quenching in the QGP medium. In this work, photon-triggered jets are studied through different jet and jet substructure observables for different collision systems and energies using the JETSCAPE framework. Since the multistage evolution used in the JETSCAPE framework is adequate to describe a wide range of experimental observables simultaneously using the same parameter tune, we use the same parameters tuned for jet and leading hadron studies. The same isolation criteria used in the experimental analysis are used to identify prompt photons for better comparison. For the first time, high-accuracy JETSCAPE results are compared with multi-energy LHC and RHIC measurements to better understand the deviations observed in prior studies. This study highlights the importance of multistage evolution for the simultaneous description of experimental observables through different collision systems and energies using a single parameter tune.",

        "abstract": "The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports the first multi-messenger study of the QGP jet transport parameter q^ using Bayesian inference, incorporating all available hadron and jet inclusive yield and jet substructure data from RHIC and the LHC. The theoretical model utilizes virtuality-dependent in-medium partonic energy loss coupled to a detailed dynamical model of QGP evolution. Tension is observed when constraining q^ for different kinematic cuts of the inclusive hadron data. The addition of substructure data is shown to improve the constraint on q^, without inducing tension with the constraint due to inclusive observables. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms of jet interactions in matter, and point to next steps in the field for comprehensive understanding of jet quenching as a probe of the QGP.",

        "abstract": "To assess how anisotropic transverse flow is created in a system out of equilibrium, we compare several kinetic-theoretical models in the few-rescatterings regime. We compare the flow harmonics $v_n$ from three types of transport simulations, with either $2\\rightarrow 2$ or $2\\rightarrow 0$ collision kernels and in the former case allowing the particles to rescatter several times or not, and from analytical calculations neglecting the gain term of the Boltzmann equation. We find that the even flow harmonics are similar in all approaches, while the odd ones differ significantly. This suggests that while even $v_n$ harmonics may to a large extent be due to the anisotropic escape probability of particles, this is not the predominant mechanism underlying the odd $v_n$ coefficients.",
